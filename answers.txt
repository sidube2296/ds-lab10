Use the example in the handout to complete the exercise.

We are searching for "hello" in the sorted array. To do binary 
search, we begin with the following interval:
lo: 0
hi: 8

Notice that hi is an index outside of the range of the array--this
is correct. The hi should not be in our search space, but one index over.

Using this interval, we find the midpoint, which is index 4. We compare
the element at index 4, "jack", with the element we are searching for, "hello".

Which side of the midpoint do we want to search?


What is our new interval and midpoint?
lo: 
hi: 
mid: 

What element do we use now to compare with "hello"?
